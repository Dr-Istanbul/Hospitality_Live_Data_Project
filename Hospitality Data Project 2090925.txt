Hi Muhammad Haseeb
I need a partner to build Dallas datasets. Restaurants: all $$+ via OpenTable, Resy, Tock (enriched w/ Maps/Yelp). Causes: PTAs/schools, Dallas-based foundations, churches, museums. Creators: 10k micro/mid (via Favikon/Modash + #LTK/#ShopMy). Clean, deduped, AWS-ready. Can you help?

Hi Brandon,
Thanks for sharing the details. Yes, I can definitely help you with building the Dallas datasets across all three categories you mentioned:



Restaurants: Collecting mid to high-end ($$+) Dallas restaurants from OpenTable, Resy, and Tock, enriched with Google Maps and Yelp details.



Causes: Building a dataset of PTAs/schools, Dallas-based foundations, churches, and museums.



Creators: Compiling 10k micro/mid creators via Favikon, Modash, and hashtags (#LTK, #ShopMy).



All datasets will be clean, deduplicated, accurate, and AWS-ready so you can directly use them.



Could you let me know your preferred deadline and the exact volume you‚Äôd like for restaurants and causes (since creators are already specified as 10k)? This will help me structure the timeline and share a clear proposal.



Best regards,
Muhammad Haseeb

Hi Brandon,



Thanks for sharing the detailed playbook. I‚Äôve reviewed it and I can definitely help with building the Dallas datasets (Restaurants, Causes, and Creators) as per your schema, filters, and cleaning rules, plus setting up the AWS infra.



On a fast-track timeline, I can deliver:



Restaurants + Causes: 2 weeks
Creators (10k influencers): 3 weeks
AWS infra setup: in parallel, total project 4‚Äì5 weeks
Budget for full build: $3,500‚Äì3,800 one-time, with $200‚Äì300/month for maintenance and updates.
We can also start with a small sample (10‚Äì15 restaurants) to confirm data quality before scaling.



Would you like me to propose a phased delivery (datasets first, infra after) or everything in one package?



Best,
Muhammad Haseeb

Thank you... I do think i would like to see this broken out between datasets first and infra after... Do you think that is the right infra set up? is that overkill?



I would like to see each rest/cause/creator with 10 lines to verify the results....

Muhammad Haseeb Javed

Hi Brandon,



Thank you for clarifying. Yes, I believe breaking this into two clear phases makes the most sense:



Phase 1 ‚Äì Datasets
We start by building out the three datasets (Restaurants, Causes, Creators). I‚Äôll first deliver 10 sample rows for each dataset so you can validate the accuracy, fields, and formatting. Once you‚Äôre satisfied with the structure and quality, I‚Äôll proceed with compiling the full datasets.



Phase 2 ‚Äì Infrastructure
After the datasets are complete and approved, we can decide whether to move forward with the infra setup. In my view, a full AWS/Docker deployment at this stage may be overkill unless you need automated scaling right away. A simpler handover (CSV/Excel, clean & deduped, AWS-ready structure) is sufficient for now. Later, if you want automated pipelines and continuous refresh, we can layer infra on top.



This step-by-step approach ensures you‚Äôre confident in the data first, before investing in infrastructure.



Best regards,
Muhammad Haseeb

ok what would the price for phase 1 be? I will have 20+ different markets that will have the same needs if we can enjoy working together on this one

Muhammad Haseeb Javed
10:38 PM
For Phase 1 (Datasets) ‚Äî covering Restaurants, Causes, and Creators for Dallas ‚Äî my price would be $250. This includes:



Clean, accurate, deduped datasets
10 sample rows per dataset, first for your review
Final delivery in a structured, AWS-ready format



If you‚Äôre happy with the process and quality, I‚Äôd be glad to replicate the same for your other markets as well. That way we can build a consistent, scalable workflow across all 20+ markets.
